# Node Minesweeper

## Setup
Clone this repository to your compy, then run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## How It Works
Follow the prompts to start and choose your difficulty level. To play a turn, type in a space on the grid in the format `X Y` and press enter. For instance, to uncover the space in the 7th column and the 5th row, type `7 5` and then enter.

To flag a space, follow the same format, but add the word "flag" at the end. For instance, `7 5 flag` or `10 6 flag`. If you enter an invalid space, you will be prompted to try again.

To win, uncover all of the spaces that are not mines. Good luck!!!
